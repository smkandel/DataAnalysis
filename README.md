# Fruits & Vegetables: Retail Trends and Cost Efficiency Insights 

## Project Objective 
The objective of this project is to analyze and visualize the pricing, yield efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of fruits and vegetables in various forms (fresh, canned, frozen, etc.) using Tableau. 

## Dataset Overview: 

The dataset provides detailed information on various fruits and vegetables, including their retail price, form (e.g., fresh, canned, frozen), yield efficiency, and cup-equivalent price. It consists of key attributes such as RetailPrice, RetailPriceUnit, Yield, CupEquivalentSize, and CupEquivalentPrice, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of cost-effectiveness and value per unit. With data spanning multiple produce types and preparation forms, this dataset enables insights into pricing trends, yield variations, and comparisons between fruits and vegetables, making it ideal for visual exploration and decision-making in Tableau.

## Question(KPIs) 

Question1: How do retail prices compare across fruits, vegetables, and forms? 

Question2 : Which items have the highest edible yield? 

Question3 : What is the cost per cup equivalent for each item and form? 

Question4: Which items are the most cost-effective based on cup-equivalent price and yield? 

## Process 

Verify data for any missing values and anomalies. 

Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format and values used. 

Used Tableau to created graphs according to questions. 

Built a dashboard. 

## Dashboard 

 

## Project Insights: 
Highest Priced Vegetables: Olives have the highest average retail price at $5.55 per pound, followed by Okra at $5.47 per pound. 
Most Expensive Fruits: Figs have the highest average retail price at $7.32 per pound, followed closely by Raspberries at $7.24 per pound. 
Most Cost-Effective Vegetables (based on Cup Equivalent Price): Collard Greens are the most affordable at $0.79 per cup, followed by Corn at $1.13 per cup. 
Most Cost-Effective Fruits: The lowest cup-equivalent price is for Strawberries at $1.04 per cup, while Raspberries are the least cost-effective at $2.41 per cup.
